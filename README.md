# Technologies Used

Structure and Layout:
Clear Sectioning: The code effectively uses sections (section) with appropriate IDs (#about, #skills, #education, #projects, #contact) to organize the content.

Semantic HTML: The use of semantic elements like header, nav, main, and footer enhances the structure and readability of the code.

Normalization: The * { margin: 0; padding: 0; box-sizing: border-box; } rule ensures consistent styling across elements.

Positioning: The navbar is positioned fixed at the top of the page, ensuring it remains visible while scrolling.

Layout: Flexbox is used to create a flexible layout for the navbar, with the logo on the left and the navigation menu on the right.

Styling: The navbar has a background color and padding, and the navigation links are styled with appropriate colors and hover effects.

Background: A background image is applied to the hero section, covering the entire viewport.
Back to Top Button: The button is styled with a circular shape and a hover effect.

Footer: The footer has a background color and text color, providing a consistent bottom section.

Responsive Design: Media queries are used to adjust the layout and styling for different screen sizes, ensuring the website is responsive.
